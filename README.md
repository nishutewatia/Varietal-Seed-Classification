# Varietal-Seed-Classification
This project is about Varietal Classification of Rice Seeds.
I had prepared Spectral and Spatial Dataset for 90 varieties of rice seeds with 96 samples of each variiety separately using image preprocessing from HSI and RGB images respectively.
I had experimented with Random Forest and Other models for this purpose and has finally used Weighted Average Ensemble Technique.
